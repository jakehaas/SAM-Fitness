This model originates from http://www.psionic3d.co.uk 

It is taken from jME samples which in turn seems to be taken from Ogre3D samples. Ogre3D team possibly converted it to their own format.

Ogre3D uses its own binary file format (.mesh and .skeleton files). But it also has a command line tool,
to convert binary files to xml files.
